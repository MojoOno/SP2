Level 4

Create a Utensil abstract class, with the following attributes and methods:
private boolean clean
private boolean polished
private String useCase

public Utensil(String useCase)
public void polish
public void clean
public boolean isClean
public boolean isPolished
public boolean forFineDining
public boolean forCooking
public void use

The constructor should set the useCase variable. The next two
methods are setter methods, setting the boolean values to true.
The last method (use) should set the clean and polished
attributes to false. The last four methods should return true
if the corresponding attribute is true/equal.

Create a Knife, Fork, Spoon and Whisk subclass. Each class
should have it's own toString() method. A Whisk should never be
for fine dining.

Create a KitchenDrawer class. The KitchenDrawer must contain a
list of Utensils. It should have the following classes:

public void add
public void remove
public void display
public String toString

Test your classes by creating a Main class with a main method.
Instantiate a KitchenDrawer and at least 12 Utensils. Some
utensils should have the useCase "fine dining", some "casual
dining" and some "cooking". Test to see if your add and
remove methods work as intended. Print the contents of the
KitchenDrawer to the console.
