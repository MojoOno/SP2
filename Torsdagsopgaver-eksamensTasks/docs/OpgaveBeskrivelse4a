Level 4.1

KitchenDrawer class continued

Expand your KitchenDrawer class with the following methods:
public Utensil getUtensil(int indexNumber)
public Knife getKnife
public Fork getFork
public Spoon getSpoon
public boolean checkIfDrawerIsClean
public void cleanAll
public void polishFineDiningUtensils


The getKnife, getFork and getSpoon methods should all work in the same
manner. The method should loop through the list of Utensils and use
the instanceof operator to check for a Knife, Fork or Spoon object
repsectively. Then remove the object from the KitchenDrawer and return it.

checkIfDrawerIsClean should loop through the Utensil list and check if
every Utensil is clean. If you encounter a dirty Utensil return false,
otherwise all Utensils must be clean and the method shpould return true.

cleanAll must loop through the Utensil list and call the clean method on
every Utensil.

polishFineDiningUtensils should loop through the Utensil list and check
if each Utensil is used for fine dining. If so, the polish method must
be called on the Utensil.

getUtensil should return the Utensil at a given index. Remember to check
that the given index is not empty.

Test the new methods in your Menuvalg.Main. You should be able to retrieve a
Spoon from the drawer, use it and then return it to the drawer.
It might look like this:
Spoon favouriteSpoon = drawer.getSpoon();
favouriteSpoon.use();
drawer.add(favouriteSpoon);
drawer.checkIfDrawerIsClean(); //Should return false now
